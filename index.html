<h1> The Great <abbr title="University of Georgia">UGA</abbr> Transition </h1>
<p> Going off to college was something that I have looked forward to since I was a little kid.
The whole idea of moving somewhere new and being on my own sounded exciting, something that most people are terrified of.</p>
<p>When the day finally came, my excitement was mixed with nervousness and sadness about living 3 hours away from everyone I love.
Move in day began with 3 vehicles packed full of all my things and 10 of my family members.
As we began unloading and setting everything up I was very overwheled and really just wanted them all to leave already.
I realized that they were just trying to help and that they were going to miss me so I just let them all do whatever they wanted to help.
When it was time to say goobye everyone hugged me and started crying. 
At this point I realized that this whole living far away thing was going to be harder than I thought. </p>

<p>
It quickly became easier, as I became more comfortable and made new friends. 
I have became so comfortable that I don't miss living at home.
